Does your team have an improvement objective? If you don't, you're probably not improving. So work out what you need to improve! Then you can use this canvas with your team to co-create a fit-for-purpose team improvement metric.

UPDATE: You might want to watch [this 30 minute video I just made](https://youtu.be/dS1tnJ3yWus) about using the canvas.
