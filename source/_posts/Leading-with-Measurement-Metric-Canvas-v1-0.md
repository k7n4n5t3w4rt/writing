We can measure for information and learning, or we can measure for improvement - it's a choice. This canvas is for designing a fit-for-purpose improvement metric. Good for OKRs, agile teams, etc.

By yourself, or in a small group:

1. Give your improvement metric a snappy name and a version number (you will need to refine it)
2. Start from anywhwere square you like, throw in ideas and decide on one thing to put in the square - except for Low Entergy Solutions which will have a few.
3. Remember the Reality Checks. If you can't check "yes" for any of those, focus there are come back for another try
